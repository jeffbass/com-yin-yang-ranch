We can start by making compost from food scraps, coffee grounds and leaves. Why? Plants combine sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to make sugars. They send many of these sugars down through their roots to feed beneficial microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, protozoa and nematodes. The plants are trading sugars (\"cakes and cookies\" per Elaine Ingham) for dense and highly available nutrients provided by the living soil food web. An old growth forest takes many years to create deep living soil, but we can accelerate the process by composting.</p>"},{"location":"#ongoing-transformation-includes","title":"Ongoing Transformation Includes ...","text":"<p>Getting rid of the lawn.
