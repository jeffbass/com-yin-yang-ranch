# Water is Precious

Yin Yang Ranch is in a valley in Ventura County in Southern California. The city
we are in gets 100% of its tap water from the MWD of Southern California. Most
cities within the MWD get their water from a mix of sources including limited 
groundwater, some seasonal streams and aqueducts from the Colorado River or
various reservoirs in Northern California. Tracking down where our water comes 
from is more challenging in Southern California than it is in many other places
in the United States. 

The tap water supply for Yin Yang Ranch comes 100% from Lake Oroville and the
Feather River that feeds it. The water travels over 500 miles through a complex
series aqueducsts, pumps and pipelines before it reaches our local water
treatment facility. Passing through so many miles of concrete aqueducts changes 
the chemistry of the water. The rainwater in the Feather River area is slighly 
acidic and has few mineral salts. But by the time the water reaches Ventura
County, it is quite alkaline and contains a variety of calcium and other salts. 

Of course, it does rain in Southern California. Our typical rainfall in our
valley is about 15 inches a year. But there is a lot of variation year to year.
Droughts have become more common in the last 30 years. We had a year of only 4 
inches of rain in 2022. But in 2023, we had 22 inches...(adjust and reference)

We do capture rainwater from our roof into barrels and use it mainly to make
compost, since compost bacteria are killed by the chlorine in tap water. We use
the rainwater for watering our native plants and fruit trees as long as it lasts
each year. The we use our chlorinated, alkaline and salty tap water to keep our 
plants alive through the dry season.
