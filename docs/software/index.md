# Software Research and Development

Yin Yang Ranch is evolving. New housing developments around us are changing the
way the local wildlife lives and travels about. As see this happening, we want to  
observe and document it. 

We are developing a network of cameras, sensors and software to track the local 
environment and its wildlife. Some of the cameras are commercial ones like
Google Nest cameras that have infrared capability. Some of the cameras are 
self-built projects we put together using small computers and camera sensors.

Jeff Bass, owner of Yin Yang Ranch, gave a talk about his open source software and its use in and around Yin Yang Ranch
project at the U.S. Python Conference PyCon 2020:

All the software we are developing is open source and described in this project 
on Gihub: [Yin Yang Ranch project overview](https://github.com/jeffbass/yin-yang-ranch)

There are also some pages there that describe our use of Raspberry Pi computers,
cameras and the housings and electronics we have built to support them.
