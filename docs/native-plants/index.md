# Native Plants. Not Lawns

Yin Yang Ranch was a typical suburban 2 acre lot when we bought it about 30 years
ago. We tore up the lawn and replaced it with Hugels and raised garden beds. We 
started out trying to grow a typical vegetable garden with tomatoes and squash
and ...

But the crittters got almost all of our vegetables. And we realized that growing
vegetables with chlorinated tap water was not as effective as buying vegetabbles
from our organic farmers using well water. So we decided to plant various native 
plants that make the best use of our limited rainwater and support the local
wildlife.

We still have some grapes and fruit trees. The birds and squirrels get most of 
the fruit...but we still get some. We grow plants like chives and mint that the 
wildlife leaves alone. We are still figuring out what works and what doesn't.

But the vast majority of plants on our farm are natives. Mostly native Coast Live 
Oaks. We have planted dozens of these along the edges of the property and along
the driveways. We have also planted many other local natives:

- Hummingbird Sage
- Laurel Sumac
- California Poppies 
- White Yarrow
- Native Milkweeds (for the Monarch Butterflies)
- Mexican Elderberry 

We always trying new plants to see what the critters are willing to share with us.
We will update this page with some of what we learn.
