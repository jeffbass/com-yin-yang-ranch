# Permaculture Farming and Gardening

## Permaculture is...

"Permaculture is a Revolution Disguised as Organic Gardening". Those of us involved with
Permaculture are trying to leave the land, its plants and its animals in better health
than when we arrived. Some call it Permaculture. Some call it Biodynamic Farming. Or
just Organic Gardening. It is caring for our land and our water with a longer term perspective. 
One of the Permaculture Design goals is to plan for a 200 year horizon. 

For a brief Permaculture overview, the Wikipedia article on Permaculture is a
good place to start: [Permaculture on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture)

## Farms and nurseries in Ventura County California

Yin Yang Ranch is one of many permaculture and native plant sites in Ventura
County, California. We are lucky to have an abundance of local resources for 
learning more about improving our soil, wildlife habitat, biodiversity and 
organic farming techniques. Here are a few:

- Apricot Lane Farms -- Their "The Biggest Little Farm" movie is one of the most
  beautiful introductions to biodynamic farming anywhere. [website](https://www.apricotlanefarms.com).
- Quail Springs Permaculture -- Teaching permaculture on a farm in the high
  desert area of Ventura County. [website](https://www.quailsprings.org). 
- Matilija Native Plants Nursery -- specializes in plants that are native to 
  Ventura County and Southern California. They propogate from seeds and cuttings. 
  [website](https://www.matilijanursery.com/about/).
- McGrath Family Farms -- a local organic teaching farm that also sells their 
  locally grown organic produce. [website](https://www.storeatmcgrath.com/about). 
- Plant Good Seed company: a local organic seed company creating locally developed seed
  varieties. [Website](https://www.plantgoodseed.com/)

## Further Permaculture Resources

For many of us, Toby Hemenway’s book Gaia’s Garden (Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture, 2nd Edition, 2009) is the best all-around reference. Here is a fun quote:

> Remember how self-reliant a natural landscape is. An ecosystem provides for itself. No one brings in truckloads of fertilizer to a forest; no one carries its waste to the dump. The forest takes care of all that internally, producing fertility and recycling litter and debris. In other words, the forest’s inputs and outputs are balanced, leaving little waste, and the work is powered by sunlight. This is the model we strive to emulate.
