We can start by making compost from food scraps, coffee grounds and leaves. Why? Plants combine sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to make sugars. They send many of these sugars down through their roots to feed beneficial microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, protozoa and nematodes. The plants are trading sugars (\"cakes and cookies\" per Elaine Ingham) for dense and highly available nutrients provided by the living soil food web. An old growth forest takes many years to create deep living soil, but we can accelerate the process by composting.</p>"},{"location":"#ongoing-transformation-includes","title":"Ongoing Transformation Includes ...","text":"<p>Getting rid of the lawn.

So we decided to plant various native  plants that make the best use of our limited rainwater and support the local wildlife.</p> <p>We still have some grapes and fruit trees. The birds and squirrels get most of  the fruit...but we still get some. We grow plants like chives and mint that the  wildlife leaves alone.

Unfortunately, our current contract expires in a couple of years and we will no longer be paid for  our excess generated power. </p> <p>We measure our solar output and correleate it with weather and time of year.

The city we are in gets 100% of its tap water from the MWD of Southern California. Most cities within the MWD get their water from a mix of sources including limited  groundwater, some seasonal streams and aqueducts from the Colorado River or various reservoirs in Northern California. Tracking down where our water comes  from is more challenging in Southern California than it is in many other places in the United States. </p> <p>The tap water supply for Yin Yang Ranch comes 100% from Lake Oroville and the Feather River that feeds it. The water travels over 500 miles through a complex series aqueducsts, pumps and pipelines before it reaches our local water treatment facility. Passing through so many miles of concrete aqueducts changes  the chemistry of the water. The rainwater in the Feather River area is slighly  acidic and has few mineral salts. But by the time the water reaches Ventura County, it is quite alkaline and contains a variety of calcium and other salts. </p> <p>Of course, it does rain in Southern California (contrary to that well known rock song). Our typical rainfall in our valley is about 15 inches a year. But there is a lot of variation year to year. Droughts have become more common in the last 30 years. We had a year of only 4  inches of rain in 2020. But in 2023, we had 22 inches. In 2004 we had 30 inches. We'll be posting some charts here soon.</p> <p>We do capture rainwater from our roof into barrels and use it mainly to make compost, since compost bacteria are killed by the chlorine in tap water. We use the rainwater for watering our native plants and fruit trees as long as it lasts each year. The we use our chlorinated, alkaline and salty tap water to keep our  plants alive through the dry season. </p>"},{"location":"wildlife/","title":"Urban Wildlife","text":"<p>Yin Yang Ranch is a suburban 2 acre lot that is a mile from a 6 lane freeway and surrounded by typical suburban neighborhoods with several lots per acre and lots  of walls and fences.
